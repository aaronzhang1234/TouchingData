The way this will work is a sql statement will entered in the top message box.
(This logic needs some help because I want to output only one amount at a time and iterate through them)
Each js document will output one part of the row of values.
The company name will be displayed in the large message box.
The amount will be displayed in the number box. (Formatting came come later)
If the amount is less than $100,000 then a note will be played. The higher the amount, the higher pitched the note.
If the amount is over $100,000 then the media from that company's website will be played and the volume of that 
media is controlled by how much money it is.
